- Create directories

- Propagate file ownership (destination file should be created by the
  uid / gid of the source file) and log it after the transfer

- Move file copying code into unprivileged and chrooted child

- Move size and time comparison out of the copier to avoid needlessly
  fork()ing a child process

- Add configuration file (separate from map file)

- Add configuration knobs for the scan frequency, both global and
  per-mapping

- Add support for include directive to include individual files or
  entire directories into both the configuration and the map

- Merge common subsets of the scan and copy child handling code
